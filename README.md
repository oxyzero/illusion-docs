# Illusion Documentation

## Introduction

Illusion is a small web framework built as a learning experience that is inspired by other frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony.
Therefore, Illusion is not intended to compete with other frameworks or to be used in real projects.
This is a side project of mine and, as a result of that, I'll only work on it on my free time.

## Components

Illusion will be built upon components. I'll try to create most of them, but I can (and probably will) make use of pre-existing components that are already built.
Examples of these components would be some of Symfony's Components and Laravel's Eloquent ORM.
This repository contains all of the documentation for every component built.

## Contributing
